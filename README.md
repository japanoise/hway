# hway - Golang "typewriter"

hway is an append-only text editor that is designed to be useful for writing
first drafts.

It opens files in an append-only mode, and appends data to the file as you type
it. You can only edit the current word (if, for example, you make a typo). It
will also automatically format your code to 80 columns, to make your plaintext
super readable.
